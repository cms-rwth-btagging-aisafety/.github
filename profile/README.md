## Hi there 👋

[We](https://www.institut3a.physik.rwth-aachen.de/cms/institut3a/Das-Institut/Profil/Prof-Dr-Alexander-Schmidt/~pwfc/Mitarbeiter/lidx/1/) develop [robust flavour tagging algorithms](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41781-022-00087-1) for the [CMS Experiment](https://cms.cern/).

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
